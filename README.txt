This is a very rough proof of concept of a mythtv guide app for android writhen in c++ using Qt and necessitas

http://sourceforge.net/p/necessitas/home/necessitas/

To do: 

- Add QFont to allow text to be shown on screen
- Redesign code so the app launches and runs properly
- Redesign app to allow modules to be added and removed
- Redesign guide
- Update to later mythprotocol to allow scheduling
